## How does database indexing work?
([stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1130/2195426))

searching on a field that isnâ€™t sorted requires a Linear Search which requires `N/2` block accesses (on average), where N is the number of blocks that the table spans. 
Whereas with a sorted field, a **Binary Search** may be used, which has `log2 N` block accesses. 

Indexing is a way of sorting a number of records on multiple fields. Creating an index on a field in a table creates another data structure which holds the field value, and a pointer to the record it relates to. This index structure is then sorted, allowing **Binary Searches** to be performed on it.
