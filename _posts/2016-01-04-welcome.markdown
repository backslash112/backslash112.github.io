Hi there, I'm Cun, from China, and now I'm living in America.

I have **seven years programming experience**, now I am studying at an university to get my **masters degree in computer science**.<br>
I know a lot of programming languages, like C#, Objective-C, Swift, Python and Java.<br>
And I use those languages into the Windows software developing, Windows Phone application developing, iOS application developing and Robot(named Pepper) software developing.

To finish my study, I am **seeking for full-time opportunities at San Francisco**. Available from June 2018.<br>
Send me an email([cun.yang@outlook.com]) if your team need a new member with rich development experience.
