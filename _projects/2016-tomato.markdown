### Introduction
Need to manage your time better, split big tasks into smaller pieces and stop giving up goals in the middle? With Tomato!, you iPhone turns into a efficient time manager and helps you to accomplish more in a day.

Different than others, you have to start a task on your own after the previous break in Tomato!. This is because we believe one should be clear when to start a task and be proactive.

Creating a Timer is just as easy. You can choose from various timers to work with and customize the number of times you want to do a task. The task you created will instantly show on the Main page. In the Main page, you can quickly start, stop, restore, mark as “done”, delete or look at the details of a task. Tasks marked as “done” will be deleted automatically if you don’t restore them in 7 days.

Tomato! has a simple, yet beautiful and harmonious user interface. We want to provide the best experience of managing your time and helping you to be more efficient, and we will keep perfecting Tomato!.
