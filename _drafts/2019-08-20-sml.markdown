[Study Notes of Coursera Course: Programming Languages, Part A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages/home/week/3)
### DAY#1
Sunday, August 18, 2019 
#### Environments setup

Udpate Aug 30, 2019:

A better way is create a Dockerfile file, and build a new docker image, and use the one-line command to start using sml directly:
Dockerfile:
```sh
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get upate && apt-get install emacs smlnj
CMD sml
```

Build and use the new image, let's call it `backslash112/sml`:
```sh
docker build -t "backslash112/sml" .
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/tmp backslash112/sml
# or
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/tmp backslash112/sml /bin/bash
```
---
Want to run SML files in macOS system but don't want install lots of packages directly? You can start a Unbuntu system by using Docker instead.
Here are the commands:
```sh
# run unbutu in docker
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD":/tmp ubuntu /bin/bash
apt-get update
# install emacs
apt-get install emacs
# install sml
apt-get install smlnj
sml
```

### DAY#2
Tuesday, August 20, 2019 
#### Questions to think about: 

1. What is "Pattern Matching"? (section 2)
2. What is "Tail Recursion"? What is "Accumulators"? What's the difference between "normal recursion" and "tail recursion"?
3. What is "Nested patterns"?
4. What are "One-of" type and "Each-of" type?
5. What is the meaning of "Conceptual Way"?

#### Answers:

1. TODO: 
2. TODO:
3. TODO:

4. Each-of and One-of:
- "Each-of": A compound type t describes values that contain each of values of type t1, t2, ..., and tn. Like tuples in SML or class in Java.
- "One-of": A compound type t describes values that contain a value of one of the types t1, t2, ..., or tn. Like `int option` in SML or subclassing in Java.
